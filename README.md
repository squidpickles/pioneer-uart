# pioneer-uart
An Arduino library for communicating with a Pioneer WYT series mini-split over UART.

This requires a control dongle attached to the Pioneer unit with a serial connection.

Protocol was reverse-engineered and likely contains a lot of errors and omissions, but it has worked ok for my purposes.
